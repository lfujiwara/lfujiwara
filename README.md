I'm Lucas, a software developer specializing in web applications. 

üíº Currently, I'm working as a full stack developer at [Opus Software](https://www.opus-software.com.br/en/better-for-enus) on a project in the credit sector. I've previously worked with point of sale systems, kitchen display systems, ERPs and also data integration and migrations between third party services.

üìí I'm studying Golang as a new language this year and also interested in learning more about TypeScript/Javascripts's functional aspects and viable patterns, such as using monads as replacement for exception-based error handling.

üõ† I'm working with Java/Spring and React at the moment. My favorite tech stack involves Node.js, React and TypeScript. I tend to gravitate towards TS and C#/.NET for back-end development for its development experience and robustness, preferrably with NestJS, TypeORM, Prisma, Jest, .NET 5+ and/or EF Core. Concerning front-end development, I can get around with Angular and Vue, but I'm more experienced towards with React, all about hooks and contexts, and maybe paired with awesome libraries such as `react-query` and `react-table` (NextJS is welcome). I have also experience using PostgreSQL (and some PostGIS), RabbitMQ and reporting).

üß± I'm used to track development using GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps and Bitbucket/Atlassian stack.

üéì I'm on my last semester pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at [University of S√£o Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/#english). My coursework was focused on software development with some emphasis on statistics and data science. I also invite you to know more about the instute's extension initiatives [here](https://bcc.ime.usp.br/principal/miscelanea/gruposExtensao.html).

üìè You can check out some of my projects:
- My and @dsnunes07 capstone project, which involved collecting, cleaning and analyzing data from companies that had affiliations with the university, extract metrics and insights and build a web application to display these metrics live. These metrics include occupation areas (general and per institute) and gender inequality. It also served as a lab to test the concept of developing a common library to be used by both front-end and back-end with TypeScript.

- Managing conccurency control with Python/FastAPI and Postgres (Portuguese), comparing pessimistic vs. optimistic and load testing with Siege:

  - Front-end: https://github.com/lfujiwara/drv-next
- My final assignment on a Data Science class, analyzing datasets of aircraft incidents from [CENIPA](https://www2.fab.mil.br/cenipa/), Wine Reviews from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews) and discussing the paper Misplaced Trust: Measuring the Interference of Machine Learning in Human Decision-Making‚Äù by Suresh et. al.:
  - https://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~lusca/mac0459.zip
- A tiny Python refactoring project, it was a take-home assignment, very simple, but I think this serves as one possible example of a clean code:

I hope to be able to contribute more the in the future, it's been a little (ü§£) rough to conciliate work, college and side projects.
